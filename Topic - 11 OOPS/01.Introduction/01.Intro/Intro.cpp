    ## Deination:-
        - OOP is a methodology or a paradigm to design a program using classes and objects.
        - we dont focus only on procedure and performance.

    ## Concept:=
        1. Data Abstraction - Only Show neccesary interface & Hide implementtation. - Security, 

        2. Data Enscapsulation - Data & object capsulate into a single unit (Class). and also class member and function

        3. Inheritance - inherit the qualities from your parents or GrandParents.

        4. Polymorphism - many form - similar code se diff functionality can be perfromed.hjhj
